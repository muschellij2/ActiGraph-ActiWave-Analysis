	Troiano 2007 non-wear algorithm
		detects non wear time from 60s epoch counts
		Nonwear was defined by an interval of at least 60 consecutive minutes of zero activity intensity counts, with allowance for 1â€“2 min of counts between 0 and 100

	Decription from original Troiano SAS CODE
	* A non-wear period starts at a minute with the intensity count of zero. Minutes with intensity count=0 or*;
	* up to 2 consecutive minutes with intensity counts between 1 and 100 are considered to be valid non-wear *;
	* minutes. A non-wear period is established when the specified length of consecutive non-wear minutes is  *;
	* reached. The non-wear period stops when any of the following conditions is met:                         *;
	*  - one minute with intensity count >100                                                                 *;
	*  - one minute with a missing intensity count                                                            *;
	*  - 3 consecutive minutes with intensity counts between 1 and 100                                        *;
	*  - the last minute of the day   


	Parameters
	------------
	data: np.array((n_samples, 3 axes))
		numpy array with 60s epoch data for axis1, axis2, and axis3 (respectively X,Y, and Z axis)
	time : np.array((n_samples, 1 axis))
		numpy array with timestamps for each epoch, note that 1 epoch is 60s
	activity_threshold : int (optional)
		The activity threshold is the value of the count that is considered "zero", since we are searching for a sequence of zero counts. Default threshold is 0
	min_period_len : int (optional)
		The minimum length of the consecutive zeros that can be considered valid non wear time. Default value is 60 (since we have 60s epoch data, this equals 60 mins)
	spike_tolerance : int (optional)
		Any count that is above the activity threshold is considered a spike. The tolerence defines the number of spikes that are acceptable within a sequence of zeros. The default is 2, meaning that we allow for 2 spikes in the data, i.e. aritifical movement
	spike_tolerenance_consecutive: Boolean (optional)
		Defines if spikes within the data need to be concecutive, thus following each other, or that the spikes can be anywhere within the non-wear sequence. Default is True, meaning that, if the tolerence is 2, two spikes need to follow each other.
	spike_stoplevel : int (Optional)
		any activity above the spike stoplevel end the non wear sequence, default to 100.
	use_vector_magnitude: Boolean (optional)
		if set to true, then use the vector magniturde of X,Y, and Z axis, otherwise, use X-axis only. Default False
	print_output : Boolean (optional)
		if set to True, then print the output of the non wear sequence, start index, end index, duration, start time, end time and epoch values. Default is False

	Returns
	---------
	non_wear_vector : np.array((n_samples, 1))
		numpy array with non wear time encoded as 0, and wear time encoded as 1.
